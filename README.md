# trollscript

Inspired by [Tom Bell's ruby implementation](https://github.com/tombell/trollscript) of trollscript, I have created a clojure trollscript interpreter.

## Usage

Using lein, your script can either run from the repl:

    lein repl

``` clojure
(interpret <trollscript here>)
```

or from the command line:

    lein run <trollscript here>
